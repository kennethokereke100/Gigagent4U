# Role-Based Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ GoalsSection.tsx Updates

**Props Enhancement:**
- Added `role?: 'talent' | 'promoter'` prop to accept role from parent component
- Uses prop role if provided, otherwise falls back to context role

**Talent Goals (2 goals):**
- ‚úÖ Complete your profile
- ‚úÖ Apply to gigs
- ‚ùå Removed: "Add your skills" (was 3rd goal)

**Promoter Goals (3 goals):**
- ‚úÖ Complete your profile
- ‚úÖ Upload an event
- ‚úÖ Invite talent

**Progress Calculation:**
- **Promoters**: 33.33% per goal (3 goals total)
- **Talents**: 50% per goal (2 goals total)

### 2. ‚úÖ gig.tsx Updates

**Role Prop Integration:**
- All `GoalsSection` components now receive `role={role || undefined}` prop
- Ensures proper TypeScript typing and null handling

**Firestore Queries (Already Correct):**
- **Talent users**: See all posts from both `posts` and `googleevents` collections
- **Promoter users**: 
  - "My Events" tab: Only their own posts (filtered by `userId`)
  - Other tabs: All posts from both collections

### 3. ‚úÖ Data Flow

**Talent Users:**
```
Firestore ‚Üí All posts + googleevents ‚Üí Display in all tabs
GoalsSection ‚Üí 2 goals (profile + apply)
```

**Promoter Users:**
```
Firestore ‚Üí All posts + googleevents ‚Üí Display in all tabs
"My Events" tab ‚Üí Filter by userId ‚Üí Show only own posts
GoalsSection ‚Üí 3 goals (profile + upload + invite)
```

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Talent User Experience:
1. **Gigs Tab**: See all posts from all users + Google events
2. **Past Tab**: See all past events from all users + Google events
3. **Invites Tab**: Empty (no invites for talent users)
4. **Goals Section**: Shows 2 goals (Complete profile, Apply to gigs)
5. **Progress**: 50% per completed goal

### ‚úÖ Promoter User Experience:
1. **My Events Tab**: See only their own posts
2. **Candidates Tab**: See candidates who applied to their events
3. **Past Events Tab**: See their own past events
4. **Goals Section**: Shows 3 goals (Complete profile, Upload event, Invite talent)
5. **Progress**: 33.33% per completed goal

## Key Features

### üéØ Role-Based Goal Display:
- **Dynamic rendering** based on user role
- **Proper progress calculation** for different goal counts
- **Confetti animation** when all goals completed (works for both roles)

### üìä Data Filtering:
- **Talent users**: See all available opportunities
- **Promoter users**: See their own events in "My Events" tab
- **Both roles**: See all events in other tabs for discovery

### üîß Technical Implementation:
- **TypeScript safety**: Proper null handling for role prop
- **Backward compatibility**: Falls back to context role if prop not provided
- **Clean separation**: Role logic isolated in GoalsSection component

## Files Modified:
- `app/components/GoalsSection.tsx` - Role-based goal rendering
- `app/screen/gigagent/gig.tsx` - Role prop passing to GoalsSection

The implementation ensures that talent users see all available opportunities while promoters can manage their own events, with appropriate goal tracking for each role! üéØ‚ú®
